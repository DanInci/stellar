# Annotation of Spatially Resolved Single-cell Data with STELLAR

PyTorch implementation of STELLAR, a geometric deep learning tool for cell-type discovery and identification in spatially resolved single-cell datasets. For a detailed description of the algorithm, please see our manuscript [Annotation of Spatially Resolved Single-cell Data with STELLAR](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.24.469947v1.full.pdf).

### Dependencies
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [PyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

### Getting started

We implemented STELLAR model in a self-contained class. To make an instance and train STELLAR:

```
stellar = STELLAR(args, labeled_X, labeled_y, unlabeled_X, labeled_pos, unlabeled_pos)
stellar.train()
_, results = stellar.pred()
```

## Datasets

CODEX multiplexed imaging datasets from healthy human tonsil and Barrettâ€™s esophagus data are made available at [dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/share/1OQtxew0Unh3iAdP-ELew-ctwuPTBz6Oy8uuyxqliZk).
